    "By default, statements in the script are executed sequentially from the first to the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the processing logic requires so, the sequentiql flow can be altered in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is True.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be reptitively ececuted as long as a certain expression is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you'll learn the decision control if, else, elif statements in Python. The comparision and logic operators are useful in controlling flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the if keyword to implement decision control. Python's syntax for executing a block vonditionally is:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Syntax\n",
    "    if[boolean expression]:\n",
    "        statement1\n",

    "Any Booloean expression evaluating True or False appears after the if keyword. One or more statements written with the same level of indent will be executed if the Boolean expression evaluates to  True.\n",
    "\n",
    "To end the block, decrease the indention. Subsequent statements after the block will be executed out of the if condition.\n",
    "    Ex--------->    if 10<100>\n",

    "Let's assume that we have to write a Python program that calculates the price and quantity and applies a 10% discount if the amount exceeds 1000 dollars.\n",
    "Calculation and application of the discount is to be done only if the amount is greater than 1000, so the process is placed in a block with increased indent, following the conditional expression.\n",
    "The print statement is written after the contitonal block is over, so it will be executed if the expression is false (i.e. the amount is not greater than 100), as well as after applying the discount if the expression is true.\n",
