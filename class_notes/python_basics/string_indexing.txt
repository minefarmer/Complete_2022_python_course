            Accessing part of a string. 
As we said before, string is a sequence of characters.

Indexing is done using []

Indexing is zero-based.

We can index using the revrse order, where -1 corresponds to the last character in the string.

If we use an index bigger than the length of the string, an error will be thrown.
