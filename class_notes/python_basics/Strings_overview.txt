            What is a string?

A string is basically a sequence of characters.

Even one character is called a string.

Even an empty string is a string.

Identified by a single or doudle quotation. "", "".

I can us both in the same code, but it is better no to.



            Quotes in a string

This will throw an syntax error
        'I'm a programmer'How to avoid the double/single hassle.

I can use special character \

For example:    "I\'m a programmer"

I can use \t
For example:    "First sentance. \t second sentance"

Special characters
    \b = backspace
    \f = new page
    \n = newline
    \t = new tab

If I want suppress the special characters.
Simply, insert r before it.

                R"THis wil not\work"
                r"nor\nthis"
